# How to start
- Models were well trained and saved in `models` folder under the main directory. For convinient use, `theme_resnet18_model.pt` and `rating_resnet18_model_v2.pt` could be used by pytorch cpu, and other trained models under this directory are used by pytorch `MPS`.
- You can start to predict a game cover image under `final.py`
